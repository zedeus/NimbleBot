# NimbleBot

Simple Telegram bot for looking up Nimble packages.

To run an instance, create a new bot with @BotFather, then save your token in a
file called `token`. This file is read at compile time from the project folder,
not the src folder.

# Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zedeus/NimbleBot
cd NimbleBot

# Create token file with bot token
nimble build
```
